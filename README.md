## Day-1-Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis
 <details>
 <summary> introduction to Verilog design and testbench </summary>
  Design:-
  The actual Verilog code or set of Verilog codes has the intended functionality to meet the required specifications.
	 
  Testbench:-
  Testbench is the setup to apply the stimulus to the design to check .its functionality.

 <summary> Introduction to Yosys </summary>
   Yosys is an open-source framework for RTL synthesis and formal verification of digital circuits. It transforms hardware descriptions written in languages like Verilog and VHDL into optimized netlists or other formats. Yosys is popular for its versatility, enabling various design transformations and analyses in the field of digital design automation.Basically, it converts RTL code into gate level netlist. As an input it takes DESIGN and .lib file and gives netlist which is nothing but the file which consists the connections of gate.

## Day-2-Timing libs, hierarchical vs flat synthesis and effcient flop coding styles

<details>
	<summary> Timing libs </summary>
	For opening a library,command :- **gvim /library_path** <br>
	There are three corners basically which are process, voltage and temperature which can be identified from the library name itself. So basically we want our silicon to work across all the corners because those three corners basically decide, how my silicon is going to work. so we need to factor in these variations while we are designing our circuit, so our library is characterized to model these variations. there are different flavours of different cells and different flavours of the same cell are available.
	<img width="600" alt="lib" src="https://github.com/gohilnihar07/Samsungpdtraining/blob/ba497da455f34a15778288bda42c074152b1dcfb/lib%20file.jpg"><br>
	For going to cell, command : / cell <br>
	<img width="600" alt="lib" src="https://github.com/gohilnihar07/Samsungpdtraining/blob/ff2c84c8133be5cd98e1e9145ee1c6421c051583/info%20of%20leakage%20power%20for%20all%20input%20combi.%20for%20a%20cell.jpg"><br>
       The keyword cell is marked at the beginning of the cell definition. For each cell it will tell you what is the leakage power for all possible input combinations<br>
	<img width="600" alt="lib" src="https://github.com/gohilnihar07/Samsungpdtraining/blob/b966e8ec355ef31b6db07d4a74a964ce34ea0f5e/lib%20it%20gives%20info%20about%20area%20and%20power%20etc...jpg"><br>
      It gives you the are number and power information of cell.<br>
	<img width="600" alt="lib" src="https://github.com/gohilnihar07/Samsungpdtraining/blob/f5374386094a0c7aea0445849005114294307a2a/lib%20pin%20info.jpg"><br>
	For every pin it describes, what's the input capacitance of the pin, what's the power related to pin, what's the delay associated to the pin, what's power associated with the pin and timing information about pin.<br> 
	For closing the cell,command :   :g// 
	Incase you want to understand  functionality or behavior of any cell, command : **:sp ../my_lib/verilog_model/sky130_fd_sc_hd_cellname.behavioral.v** <br>
	For picking any particular cell, command : /cell .*cell_name <br>
	For separating the same screen, command : :vsp <br>
	From the same cell with two or three different flavours we can observe the cell area information and from that we can say, the cell with higher area(wider area cell) is faster cell and the cell with lesser area is slower cell and also wider cell consumes more power and having less delay, vice versa.<br>

	<summary> Hierarchical Vs Flat synthesis </summary>
To understand the difference between hierarchical synthesis vs flat synthesis, we will take example of one design named multiple_modules.in below figure from the design we can see that there is one OR gate and one AND gate presenst.  <br>
<img width="600" alt="lib" src="https://github.com/gohilnihar07/Samsungpdtraining/blob/ba497da455f34a15778288bda42c074152b1dcfb/lib%20file.jpg"><br>
Now, let's see when we synthesize it how does it make difference, and by default synthesis will be hierarchical synthesis.<br>
As we can see graphical representation of hierarchical synthesis in below figure from thatb we can say it's not showing the AND and OR gate but it's showing in the form of sub module1 and sub module2, so this is what basically hierarchical synthesis is, which infered the modules.<br>

<img width="600" alt="netlist" src="https://github.com/gohilnihar07/Samsungpdtraining/blob/c8721bed7184c2ad59e8ed67be9277f76e0428ee/hierarcies%20are%20preserved.jpg"><br>
	<img width="600" alt="lib" src="https://github.com/gohilnihar07/Samsungpdtraining/blob/d0422cfa563b5097a6555aa56bd367db5d62a346/hierarcy_synthesis_infered.jpg"><br>
 Here also in the below figure of generated netlist, we can see it preserves hierarchy.<br>
 <img width="600" alt="netlist" src="https://github.com/gohilnihar07/Samsungpdtraining/blob/36f6a31ab857072270000ae0c196a561623ca6d1/even%20in%20the%20generated%20netlist%20also%20we%20can%20see%20that%20the%20hierarcy%20preserves.jpg"><br>
 Now for flat synthesis after linking the design to library write, command : flatten <br>
 Can see the graphical representation for flat synthesis in below figure, <br>
 
<img width="600" alt="netlist" src="https://github.com/gohilnihar07/Samsungpdtraining/blob/10e33b875b7f2307c7e4a487ead123aeca51b57e/so%20in%20flatten%20synthesis%20we%20can%20directly%20see%20the%20structure%20completely.jpg"><br>
So, from above figure we can say that, in flatten synthesis we can see whole structure(every gate).<br>
 
<img width="600" alt="netlist" src="https://github.com/gohilnihar07/Samsungpdtraining/blob/84e741ae2c240337fe1a1057912da4482d490863/flat_synthesis_netlist.jpg"><br>
The single netlist will be generated of multiple_module, underneath we can see everything.<br>

We can do synthesis at sub module level also, command : synth -top sub_module_name
Basically in some cases it's preferable to do synthesis at sub module level,<br>
1. It's preferred when we have multiple instances of same module. so, instead of synthesizing one sub module many times, it's better to synthesize it once and then replicate it as much times as needed and then stitch it to together in top module.<br>
2. Divide and conquer. like when your design is massive in that case let's say your tool is not doing good job, so instead of giving massive design to the tool, giving portion by portion to the tool so that it writes out very optimize netlist and then you stich it together at the top module.<br>
Can see the below netlist which is generated for sub module,<br>
<img width="600" alt="netlist" src="https://github.com/gohilnihar07/Samsungpdtraining/blob/196a5a276c197992349ef29e0ba40ade228e7de5/netlist%20for%20sub_module%20level%20synthesis.jpg"><br>

 <summary> Flop coding style, simulation and synthesis</summary>
	 We required flop beacause due to the diffferent propagation delay of gates at the output glitches may come, so to overcome glitch problem, in between combinational circuit we keep flipflop to avoid glitches.And to control the flop there is a set and reset which we can design synchronous or asynchronous based on our requirements.<br>
	
 **Below is the code for asynchronous reset D flip flop**,

module dff_asyncres ( input clk ,  input async_reset , input d , output reg q ); <br>
always @ (posedge clk , posedge async_reset) <br>
begin<br>
	if(async_reset)<br>
		q <= 1'b0;<br>
	else	<br>
		q <= d;<br>
end<br>
endmodule<br>

  After simulating we can see the GTK waveforms shown in below figure,<br>

 **Below is the code for asynchronous set D flip flop**,<br>

 
module dff_async_set ( input clk ,  input async_set , input d , output reg q );<br>
always @ (posedge clk , posedge async_set)<br>
begin<br>
	if(async_set)<br>
		q <= 1'b1;<br>
	else	<br>
		q <= d;<br>
